They will be then given the choice to view existing stories or create their own. If they choose to view, they will be shown the latest entries in each story and prompted to add to a story. Once they submit, they will be able to view their contributions but not edit them. Alternatively, they can choose to start their own story and add a title. Afterwards, all stories that the user contributed to wwill be displayed to user. Once they are done, they can logout, which will display a confirmation screen.
